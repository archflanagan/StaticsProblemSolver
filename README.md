# A Project Dedicated to Solving Statics Problems
As a mechanical engineering student at NC State University, I took the same Sophomore statics
course as everyone else. I spent a great amount of time on the homework, and learned a great
deal in the class. Later in my college career, after picking up a computer science minor, I
wondered if there was any way to solve these problems, as many of them are very similar in concept.
This is a project created by Arch Flanagan, and is a work in progress as of 5/21/22.
